ðŸ“Œ Description:
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the data cleaning process on a sample dataset using Python. It includes handling of missing values, data type conversions, duplicate removal, and outlier detection using libraries like Pandas and NumPy. This file is part of a data preprocessing task during a machine learning internship.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Importing and exploring the dataset
Identifying and managing null values (dropna, fillna)
Converting data types where required
Detecting and removing duplicates
Checking for outliers
Saving the cleaned dataset

ðŸ§° Libraries Used:
    pandas
    numpy

âœ… Purpose:
This notebook serves as a foundational step for building a clean and reliable dataset, which is crucial for any machine learning model's performance.
